# LeoEcsLite.EntityBuilder

A Unity package for LeoEcsLite that simplifies setting up GameObjects in the scene for conversion into entities with a required set of components.

This package is primarily developed for my personal use and projects. However, if it proves useful to anyone, I'd be happy to receive feedback. I'm especially open to suggestions for interesting features that could enhance this repository.
